# Starter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Alymosul/starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Alymosul/starter)
This is a template repository contains packages and integrations that are used in most of the laravel projects i build.

I recommend you to follow the idea of having a master and a development branch, the master branch contains the current release of your app and the development branch contains the coming release of your app.
